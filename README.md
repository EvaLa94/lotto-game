## Italian Lottery Game

This project simulates the Italian lottery game.

The lottery game (or "Lotto") is based on an extraction of numbers with cash prizes in case of winning.

In particular, the Lotto game involves the extraction of 5 numbers (between 1 and 90) for each of 10 italian cities:

- Bari
- Cagliari
- Firenze
- Genova
- Milano
- Napoli
- Palermo
- Roma
- Torino
- Venezia

It is possible to bet until 10 numbers and choose different types of play:

- _Ambata_: guess one extracted number
- _Ambo_: guess two extracted numbers
- _Terno_: guess three extracted numbers
- _Quaterna_: guess four extracted numbers
- _Cinquina_: guess five extracted numbers
